Some time ago I had to implement an image gallery within a `shiny` application. A simple grid of small thumbnail images where clicking opens the full image.  Nothing complicated, but I did have several requirements:

  1. The gallery needed to render from a folder of images
  2. The gallery interface and thumbnails needed to be responsive
  3. The gallery needed to link to other `shiny` UI
  4. Images come from one location, no need for generating thumbnails
  
There is a wide variety of javascript image gallery implementations. To start with I looked at  [Lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) and [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/). `Lightbox` was the easiest to use and many other `JS` libraries are based on it. `Photoswipe` is also very popular with a very nice UI, zoom and touch integration plus an extensive API. Both are available under MIT licences. Unfortunately my javascript is limited and I did not have enough time to get more than the most basic `Photoswipe` gallery to work. But, the `Lightbox` gallery works very nicely.

This work was eventually built into a [shiny app](https://mrjoh3.shinyapps.io/shiny-gallery-example/) so you can see the galleries in action. I have also wrapped the code in the [gallerier](https://github.com/mrjoh3/gallerier) package. `Gallerier` can be used in both `shiny` and `rmarkdown` documents. Code for the original `shiny` app is on [Github](https://github.com/mrjoh3/shiny-gallery-example).

The `gallerier` is very much a work in progress and more proof-of-concept than usable package. Please us it if you wish and let me know how you get on. The package also has some other functionality for creating card packs, but I will discuss this in a separate post.


## Using Lightbox in R

The great thing about Lightbox is that the setup is relatively easy. For a gallery all it requires is the creation of a structured "image set". The "image set" defines the location of the images and any metadata you wish to display. If you look at the [Lightbox documentation](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#getting-started) the "image set" is a group of image links that look like this:

```html
<a href="images/image-2.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #2</a>
<a href="images/image-3.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #3</a>
<a href="images/image-4.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip">Image #4</a>
```

To to recreate this in `R` add all the required details to a `data.frame`, then iterate over the rows and using `htmltools` to create a `taglist`. 

```r
tagList(
  lapply(seq_len(nrow(df)), function(i){
    tags$a(id = 'image ID',
           href = 'path to image',
           `data-lightbox` = 'gallery group name', 
           `data-title` = 'metadata to display', 
           tags$img(class = 'card-img-top',
                    src = 'path to image',
                    width = 'image width px'),
                    height = 'auto')
  })
)
```

The [code](https://github.com/mrjoh3/gallerier/blob/master/R/lightbox.R) in `gallerier` also adds each image to a [HTML card](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp). This makes it a little easier to format the images and make the gallery look nice and consistent; plus it makes the gallery responsive to small screens and changes in screen size. 


## An Example

In this example we iterate over a folder of images and extract some metadata from the image file name. We also add an id key using `hashids::encode()` as each image tag needs a unique id for the `lightbox` gallery. This is particularly important where you have multiple galleries on one page. The only required field in the `data.frame` is the `src` field. Any other fields will be joined together to form the metadata description that displays under each image after it is selected.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(hashids)
library(gallerier)

images <- data.frame(src = list.files('www/img')) %>%
  tidyr::separate(col = 'src', 
                  c('txt', 'date', 'time', 'msec'), 
                  sep = '_|\\.', 
                  remove = FALSE) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(date = as.character(lubridate::ymd(date)),
         key = hashids::encode(1e3 + as.integer(msec), 
                               hashid_settings(salt = 'this is my salt')))

```

Then we pass the `data.frame` to the `gallerier::lightbox_gallery()` function and tell it where the images can be found relative to the final `HTML` page. This can sometimes take a couple of goes to get right depending on which framework you are using. For `shiny` the images will need to be in a `www/img` folder. But the `www` is dropped within shiny so the referenced path would be `img/`. For `rmarkdown` the `www` does not get dropped, so `path='www/img'`. This blog is created using `blogdown` and so the images need to be in the `static` folder, but are then referenced as `path='../../img/'`.


## Some Gotcha's

As indicated above, referring to the image location can be quite variable. This is also the case for referring to the required `JavaScript` and `CSS` files. In `shiny` the `gallerier::lightbox_gallery()` embeds all the required files, but this does not work in `rmarkdown`. At least, I have not managed to get it to work. What does work is explicitly referencing the files at the top of the `.Rmd` file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="www/lightbox-2-2.11.3/css/lightbox.min.css">
<script src="www/lightbox-2-2.11.3/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js"></script>
```

You will notice in the code above I referenced the `JS` file `lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js`. This is because the `Hugo` theme that this blog uses does not include `jquery`, luckily this file has it embedded. If you are using `shiny` or `rmarkdown`, `jquery` is already available, so you would refer to `lightbox.min.js`.


## The Gallery

Below is the final result. I am pretty happy with the look of the gallery and the functionality of `lightbox`. Getting this to work in `shiny` was straight forward and `rmarkdown` was not too bad. But I did have a very hard time with `blogdown`. Mostly it took far too long for me to realise that `jquery` was missing as I had not had to load it in the other frameworks.

To render the gallery pass the `data.frame` to the `lightbox_gallery()` function. Give the gallery a name, define the image file path, and that is it.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
images %>%
  lightbox_gallery(., 'name-of-gallery', 
                   path = '../../img/',
                   display = TRUE)
```
