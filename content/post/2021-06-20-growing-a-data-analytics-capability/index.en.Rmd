nobody cares about your P value. They only want to know if the model works or not

validation needs to be commensurate with the consequence of getting things wrong

Also need to think about consequences as that relate to false positive or negative, who is burdened by these and is that ok
  could use robo debt as example burden of false positive put onto sensitive group
  
process documentation and workflow makes a team as opposed to a group of individuals working on similar issues

organisational enablers: known data quality, data engineering, project management, licence to fail
