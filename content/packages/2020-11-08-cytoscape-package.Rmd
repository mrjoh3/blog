A HTMLWidget wrapper for the [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) graph / network visualisation and analysis library. There are already a number of existing `R` packages for Cytoscape such as the [Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html) and the official [Cytoscape Widget](https://github.com/cytoscape/r-cytoscape.js). The purpose of this package is to make the process of producing a basic chart as simple as possible.
